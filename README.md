# Data-Modeling
We will format the raw data in the useable format
the main trick is we will not use update, alter or into function inbetween
the program should be complete in a single programming

--To get the country code from order id starting of 2 digit
--By using function we will find the order code and order number from the order_id that is combined, so we will seperate them 
--Next we will find the order year, order month and order year_month, order day and order quarter month from the order_date column
--We will find the days gap between ordered date and ship date by using datediff
--And we will find the age from DOB same by using function datediff
--After finding age we will put the age into age bucket 30-49, 50-70, Less Then 30
--Customer First_name and Last_name and convert the null values from postal code and update to 0 for null 
--Give Currency Format to sales, Discount to percentage, find discount amount, sales after discount, profit in dollat, 

Thank You
